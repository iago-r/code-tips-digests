# Code Tips Digests
I'll try to create small digests with programming tips in the languages I'm learning.
<hr>
Many times we want to learn a new programming language and we want to have at our disposal small summaries with the essence of that language.

My intention, in this repository, is to provide, both for the general public and for myself, small files of, at most, one page, that contain the most interesting topics of the programming languages that I am learning.

I am available for any suggestions!
